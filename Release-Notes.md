|23497|API|Optimization|Even though correct culture is applied in the actual render format caption is incorrect. The reason is that AdHocSettings.Formats collection is stored on the application level.|
|23500|Dashboards|Export|When emailing dashboards from Izenda, 'Send as Link' fails in both cases. For non-saved dashboard it throws error in browser console as customer described. For existing/saved dashboards it doesn't throw error, but also does nothing at all - no email arrives to mailbox.|

|23659|API|Optimization|Resolved issue where the report that was opened last in a new tab/window will be exported (in IE), no mattter which report is currently being viewed.|
|23666|API|Optimization|Fixed issue when there is multiple values set on the filter (BetweenTwoDates), the filter values are written as xml elements right before the SqlOverrride xml attribute is written. This causes the XmlWriter method to fail because the state of the XmlWriter changes to content when the "Values" elements are added. When the state of the XmlWriter is content, attributes can no longer be added.|
|23675|Instant Reports|Optimization|IR2.0 - Error message: Cannot read property 'ci' of undefined|
|23676|Report Design|Filters|Special Characters in Filter create no results when selected from equals select type filters.|

|23727|API|Optimization|When AdHocSettings.ShowStackTrace=false; stacktrace link was disabled, but hyperlink text remains.|
|23734|API|Optimization|Method "ReportSet.GenerateOutput" is used in the ReportRenderer class in the following methods: ExportReportSet(string reportName, string output) ExportReportSet(string reportName, string output, string filters) also the ReportRenderer class has other two methods: RenderReportSet(string reportName) RenderReportSetWithFilters(string reportName, string filters) These have been obsolesced and removed from the Izenda API.

|23865|API|Optimization|AdHocSettings.RedirectExports added back to AdHocSettings.|
|23882|API|Export|With csv exports the same data is getting repeated row after row for exported csv files. So, if there is a report that has 50 unique rows, CSV export will repeat the first row 50 times.|
|23899|API|Optimization|Now universal standard set of TimeZones is used everywhere including Daylight Savings Time support. This change should be compatible with the previous versions since offset-based timezones are automatically converted to the new timezones.|

## **Hotfix (March 24, 2016)**
|Case|Category|Subcategory|Description|
|:----|:-----------|:----------------|:---------------|
|**HF:23784**|VisualGroups|Bug| Fixed: First field in a report, with VG enabled, can disappear when subtotals added and report is previewed.|
|**HF:23491**|Joins|Bug| Fixed: Issue where if you to add multiple joins to the same table you must save the report in between adding each field in order for additional table joins to appear.|

## Features

|Case|Category|Subcategory|Description|
|:----|:-----------|:----------------|:---------------|
|8453|API|Feature| Izenda Reports - Added labels (EX: SUM, COUNT) that appear on the hover-over of a subtotal.|
|11189|API|Feature| Addition of commentary to Izenda serialization.|
|21937|Dashboards|Feature| Dash2.0 - Adding support for Fusion Report Cache timestamp to appear on report tiles in new Dashboard.|
|22505|Instant Reports|Feature| Dash2.0 - Ability added to easily set default category in Dash2.0 in code. Settings in file: "Resources/components/dashboards/module-definition.js" // dashboard config object: angular.module('izendaDashboard').constant('izendaDashboardConfig', { showDashboardToolbar: true, defaultDashboardCategory: 'Filters', defaultDashboardName: 'dashboard Autocomplete Filter' });|
|22537|API|Feature| Refactored Datatable class to increase performance on larger data sets. Implemented setting AdHocSettings.ClearManagedMemoryOnRender, this false by default. When set to true .NET Garbage Collector is explicitly called. To take full advantage of these changes in the Datatable class custom formats can be updated to use the following: **1) Replace IFormatter with BaseFormatter** **2) Replace all DataTable occurrences with AdHocDataTable** **3) Add override key words to the methods:** `"public Type GetOutputDataType" -> "public override Type GetOutputDataType" - "public object Format" -> "public override object Format"` http://wiki.izenda.us/Release-Notes/Code-for-22537-ReleaseNote _**All previous implementations of IFormat will still work, but will not take advantage of the optimizations in the new Datatable implementation**_. |
|22749|Report Design|Feature| Cell Highlight - 'High' 'Medium' and 'Low' strings can no longer be used to address the upper, middle, and lower thirds of a range in highlighting or value range aliasing. You can use "x% to y%" range syntax to establish custom proportional ranges instead. High, Medium and Low will now function properly as strings.|
|23025|Instant Reports|Logging|Feature: IR2.0 (BETA) - Support for Filter Regex added to IR2.0.|
|23039|Scheduler|Logging|Feature: Scheduling - Added ability of configure local SMTP port.

# 6.10.0.3 (February 23, 2016)

## Features

|Case|Category|Subcategory|Description|
|:----|:-----------|:----------------|:---------------|
|**HF:23222**|Report Design|Data Sources|**Hot Fix (03/02/2016)** Fixed: Bug limiting maximum number of joins to ~10 corrected. When adding data sources in Report Designer Advanced mode, additional copies of the same table were not being aliased to allow for self joining|
|19644|API|Optimization|Added intelligent schema labelling in ReportDesigner 'DataSources' tab, which applies schema names when two DataSources have the same name from two different schemas.|
|20555|Report Viewer|Optimization|Added Support of Server Side sorting in the Report Viewer. Setting which controls the behavior is AdHocSettings.SortGridOnServerInViewer. The default value is set to false so the behavior will remain the same for all existing customers. This change only works in the Report Viewer, on other pages default client-side filtering should be utilized by changing the sort on the field in the designer. - All active field settings are shown and user can change the sort on multiple columns. With pure client-side sorting there is no way to apply sorting hierarchy while in this case we can do this so user can cycle asc/desc/none sorting on any column keeping previously saved sort. For instance, you could sort by Country and by City using this new feature while with the old sorting you can sort either by Country or by City. Applied sorting is respected in exports. In case of a pagination current page is preserved.|
|22561|API|Optimization|Added setting for number of recently updated reports to allow client to set a value for how many should be displayed.  The default value for the new setting, AdHocSettings.RecentlyUpdatedCountAtReportList is 10 but any other interger may be used.|
|22608|Instant Reports|Optimization|Added support for BETA Instant Report page for user to drag new field into the work area between two existing fields on a report. User can drag existing fields around in the report work area to change position as well.|
|22703|Instant Reports|Optimization|Adding support for creating pivots in the BETA New Instant Report page. [Documentation](http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/Instant-Reports-v2-BETA#Adding-a-Pivot---Added-6.10.0.3-Release)|
|22704|Instant Reports|UI|New BETA Instant Report - Rearranged the Field formatting options on the field panel. [Documentation](http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/Instant-Reports-v2-BETA#Field-Settings---Updated-6.10.0.3-Release)|
|22708|Instant Reports|Optimization|Enabled full support of FUSION with DataSourceCategories API for InstantReports 1.0/2.0. FUSION connections and DataSourceCategories now both create hierarchies in IR 1.0/2.0.|
|23251|Report Design|Expressions|Changed default of value of AdHocSettings.ShowModifiedReportMessage to false from true. This feature has been noted to cause issues for some client and the default has been changed until a final resolution can be made to enhance the feature.|

|22673|API|Optimization|When using a field where the data contains a comma "," as a drill down filter the comma was not properly escaped in code.

|22898|API|Optimization|Setting AdHocSettings.ApplicationHeaderImageUrl not working properly in Webforms VB kit. Issue resolved. Issue can be resolved without this fix by uncommenting the following lines in default.master.vb: 'If (Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(AdHocSettings.ApplicationHeaderImageUrl)) Then ' rightLogo.Src = AdHocSettings.ApplicationHeaderImageUrl 'End If|

|Case|Category|Subcategory|Description|
|:----|:-----------|:----------------|:---------------|
|**HF:23145**|Report Design|Filter|**Hot Fix (02/09/2016)** for new Date/Time picker feature. By default, the date picker does not use time. The picker can be changed to use Date & Time by using AdHocSettings.ShowTimeInFilterPickers = true. <br/><br/>This ticket resolves the following issues: <br/>1 - Dashboard scheduling was inoperable after the date/time picker was added. This is now resolved <br/>2 - Date/Time Picker respects dates using European format in the filter operator. <br/>3 - The second date for Between Calendar operator was defaulting to the beginning of the day (00:00:00). It now defaults to end of the day (23:59:59). This can be modified by the user, but the second date cannot be set to (00:00:00) it should be set to the day prior and the midnight default (23:59:59). These time defaults match the Izenda queries used if the time function is not used. <br/>4 - Previously when user is manually entering data, the cursor is moved to the "Time" field in the date time picker. This has been resolved. <br/>5 - Date picker icons have different vertical alignment in the Report Viewer and in  the Dashboard page. The issue is addressed the new date time picker, which is larger than the old date only version. For this reason the focus for selection had to be changed to the calendar icon to avoid covering the input fields for smaller screens if the user wants to type in the date. Previously, the user could click in the input field to use the picker, now the pickers must be selected by clicking the calendar icon. <br/>6 - Previously, if the user used "AdHocSettings.Language/AdHocSettings.Culture" to implement foreign language settings, the culture was not respected by the date/time picker. The new changes implemented in the current release enabled " AdHocSettings.Language = AdHocLanguage." to automatically set the culture settings when a language is selected i.e. DateTime fields & Currency fields will get adjusted to Language chosen. e.g. When user selects "French" as the language to be implemented then the setting will be " AdHocSettings.Language = AdHocLanguage.French". The Date format will change to European i.e. DD/MM/YYYY & Currency will be changed to Euro.|
|17815|API|Optimization|AdHocSettings.AllowVisualGroups setting is deprecated and will no longer be available.|
|19792|Report List|Optimization|Enhancement of thumbnail generation process fixing incompatibilities with Azure Web Apps and other scenarios with COM restrictions. Reports must be opened in the Report Viewer to generate the thumbnail.|

|21930|Report Design|Optimization|Fix: Erroneous long decimal values in Dashboard.|
|21934|Report Design|Optimization|Fixed long load times as StoredProcedures queried on rpeport load. If following setting is added to Global: AdHocSettings.ValidateExistingReportsInDesigner = false; then Izenda doesn't validate tables/columns in database for existing reports when constructing list of them for reportDesigner (so it still checks if user has access rights to this reportset, tenant, etc. Also it doesn't affect ReportList or anything else except designer). This results in much faster reportDesigner loading, along with no pulling any StoredPProcedure metadata from database for existing reports, though reportDesigner will still show list of subreports, mark datasources which are used in any reports, etc.|
|21935|Feature|Optimization|Fixed Oracle numeric types mapping bug and added datatype mapping control. EX: AdHocContext.Driver.NativeToInternalTypesMap["NUMBER(18,0)"] = SqlType.TimeStamp;|

# 6.10.0.1 (December 29, 2015)

##Features
|Case|Category|SubCategory|Description|
|:----|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|
|**Architecture Update**|**Internal**|**Browser Support**|**Izenda 6.10.0.x versions have dropped support for IE8. IE9+ must be used for versions 6.10.0.1 and later. While users may still be able to access the application from IE8 new and or existing features and functionality may no longer work in these browsers. In addition, bugs or performance issues that appear only when using IE8 will not be investigated or fixed after this release.**|
|**HF:22762**|**Security**|**License Conflict**|**Hotfix patch to Izenda 6.10.0.1 to resolve a licensing conflict. (01/05/2016)**|
|FB:22008|Framework|.NET Version Update |**Updated the Izenda .NET framework to 4.0**|
|FB:13917|Data|Data Sources|Feature - Addition of support for Oracle Stored Procedures. The only stored procedures supported at this time are pipelined functions that return a table-valued object. See [[this documentation|http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14289/dcitblfns.htm]] for more details on table-valued pipelined functions. Functionally, these work just like MSSQL stored procedures as far as Izenda is concerned. The processes for including them in VisibleDataSources, working with constraints, passing parameters as filters, etc are the same.|
|FB:21959|Data|Data Sources|Feature - Addition of MySQL Stored Procedure support. The only stored procedures supported at this time MUST be formatted a specific way for Izenda to be able to use them. The connection string must use the MULTI_STATEMENTS=1 identifier. The procedures themselves must use the following syntax: DELIMITER $$ BEGIN DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `[SprocName]_spResult`; /* Izenda-specific code */ CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `[SprocName]_spResult` AS /* Izenda-specific code */ [The normal sproc body goes here] SELECT * FROM `[SprocName]_spResult`; /* Izenda-specific code */ END$$ DELIMITER ; where [SprocName] is the exact name of your stored procedure without the brackets. Functionally, these work just like MSSQL stored procedures as far as Izenda is concerned. The processes for including them in VisibleDataSources, working with constraints, passing parameters as filters, etc are the same. Be sure to change the DELIMITER to something other than the semicolon or else MySQL will not correctly compile the stored procedure.|
|FB:22093|API|Cache|Feature - Add support to allow 'InvalidateSchemaCache' to be executed across entire webfarm. New setting implemented, activated through a single setting. If there are two machines "server1" and "server2" in webfarm, for both servers, use the following setting in InitializeReporting:AdHocSettings.WebFarmNodesRsUrls = new string[] { "http://server1/rs.aspx", "http://server2/rs.aspx" }; When invalidate schema cache is used it works across all machines.|
|FB:19135|API|Session State|Feature - Added IDataStorage interface to allow customization of the storage mechanisms for sessions. Izenda can be configured to use a custom class that implements this interface. Sample use:// This code should be placed before any Izenda calls.AdHocContext.Storage = new CustomSessionStorage(); A code sample was created to illustrate the concepts. Code Sample available [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/Release-Notes/sessionsample.txt)|
|FB:19705|Report Design|Filters|Feature – Add Filter Alias. Prior to this new feature filters must be named the same as the column name or Field Alias set in code. Now to alias filters there are 2 options 1 – Use AdHocSettings.FilterAliases to set the alias for how column names are displayed in the filter selection drop down from code. 2 – User can change the filter name using the new Description field. This can be accessed in the Report designer from the filter tab or from the viewer by clicking the gear icon in the filter. The logic of applying aliases is the following (from the highest priority to the lowest): 1) Defined by the user alias - Description property of the filter 2) AdHocSettings.FilterAliases 3) AdHocSettings.FieldAliases 4) Column name. More information can be found [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/ReportDesign/5.0-Filters-tab)|
|FB:19756|API|Caching|Feature - Cache Interface Added. The first phase of cache changes to allow easy customization of the caching mechanism(s) used in Izenda. A new cache interface (IPermanentDataCache) was implemented for two Izenda data caches. RenderedResultsCache: the Fusion(HTML) cache DatabaseSchemaCache: used to cache the schema information. With these changes, any caching provider can be used by implementing the IPermanentDataCache interface in a custom class and configuring Izenda to use the custom class. AdHoc.Cache.DataCache.IPermanentDataCache is called "permanent" because for these caches we do not use the "storage" expiration approach. The expiration policy of all objects in the cache can be controlled by custom code. - Custom caches can be specified using AdHocContext.Caches property. Currently DataCacheRepository contain only two caches - RenderedResultsCache and DatabaseSchemaCache but we will expand this list to more different caches. Having one repository will make adding them easier in the future. Here is how you can apply custom class for DB cache: AdHocContext.Caches.DatabaseSchemaCache = new CustomDbSchemaCache(); And here is the same for Fusion cache: AdHocContext.Caches.RenderedResultsCache = new CustomHtmlCache(); Be sure to do this before all other Izenda calls. A sample Redis cache for DB Schema has been created for reference. This was implemented using Redis. Code Sample available [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/Release-Notes/CacheSample.txt)|
|FB:19815|Instant Reports|New BETA Page|Feature - The new Instant Report Designer page is being released as a *BETA* version in the Izenda 6.10.0.1 release. This beta release is made available to allow a broad user base to evaluate and give us feedback on the future of the Report Designer, but is not recommended for production use at this stage. This is not a fully supported feature however and any product defects will be noted, but not slated for immediately scheduled work.Please review documentation [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/Instant-Reports-v2-BETA)|
|FB:21663|Printing|PDF Support In Azure|Addition of new PDF engine - EVO. Provides Azure support via cloud service. There is a known issue with HTML charts and EVO printing that is scheduled for resolution in 6.10.0.2. Learn more on this configuring the cloud service [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/API/CodeSamples/PdfPrintMode#PdfPrintMode)|

# 6.9.0.7 (November 25, 2015)

|Case|Category|SubCategory|Description|
|:----|:-----------|:----------------|:---------------|
|21723|API|Saving|Categories with apostrophes in names are causing Visualizations option to disappear in the chart tab of the Report Designer. This was also causing existing reports with Visualizations contained to be unavailable. Resolved.|
|22127|Scheduler|Export|Implemented support for the following settings system wide for scheduler. AdHocSettings.SmtpPort = ; AdHocSettings.SmtpSecureConnection = true; Previously these were only used from Dashboard 2.0, now these can be used with all standard scheduled items.|
|21944|API|Fusion|Found with this Fusion Implementation below, some Visible Data Dources were not being displayed: AdHocSettings.VisibleDataSources = new string[] { "central/CustOrderHist" }; FusionDriver fd = new FusionDriver(); fd.AddConnection("central", FusionConnectionType.MsSql, @"Persist Security Info=False;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;"); AdHocContext.Driver = fd; Resolved and now all Visible Data Sources are showing as Data Sources.|
|21946|API|Security|Security issue where the connection string used by Izenda was recorded in logs found and fixed.|
|21964|UI|UI|Changing notice on Settings page to remove "Izenda". New warning text "The settings page is intended for trials and evaluations. For a production environment: All new settings, changes made to existing settings, and tests of settings should be implemented via the API in the global.asax - or wherever you instantiate the AdHocSettings class."|
|22271|API|UI|Added the following setting to Global file for new Reference Implementations AdHocSettings.ShowModifiedReportMessage = false; Default implementation of this setting is True, but some customers have seen issues with the setting. Turning off by default in Global only until final resolution can be made on cause of false errors. This does not affect anyone upgrading, this will only be seen if downloading new RI.|

|22045|Report Design|Visualization|New Setting On Both Detail and Summary Tabs - "Hide Grid". When this is checked the grid for summary / detail will be hidden in the report. This is useful to hide the detail if you do not want to see it after building a visualization. Hiding a field will remove it from the visualization, but hiding the grid will remove the entire detail / summary report part. Detail/Summary will still appear in Dashboard as available report part, but will not display if selected.|
|22001|API|Security|When AdHocSettings.ShowDesignLinks = false, all buttons and links to the report designer should be hidden from the user. However, in Dash.aspx, the icon still exists and still links to ReportDesigner.aspx when a tile is reversed to show settings. Fixed|

|22280|Dashboards|Optimization|Fixed spelling issue in dashboard - on reverse side of tile the hover text shows "Select a preport part to add" fixed to state "Select a report part to add".|
|21906|API|Filters|When setting up ProcessEqualsSelectList to populate a drop down filter, and using auto complete filter operator (@autoCompleteVal), the autocompleted filter value is not updated in the filter collection. This is used in the where clause of any subsequent filters when implementing cascading filter functionality. This value is now retained and can be used for cascading.|
|21707|API|Data Sources|Database objects with Period "." in Column name displaying literal string "_INTERALDOTCHAR_" in column name in Izenda. This was due to internal literal string replacement in code. Resolved.|
|21791|Report Design|Export|Implemented new method of rendering dates to excel, which solves a lot of problems/cases like given one with dates formatting in Excel. Previously, when exporting to Excel, Izenda converted datetime values to string (text) of necessary format, and wrote those string values to html file with a mark for Excel that they are dates in some string format. Now when exporting to Excel, it writes to HTML the native for excel numeric value of date, and description of format in which this date should be shown.|
|21862|UI|Optimization|CSS files were reloading from iis server versus from local cache causing lag time. Change implemented to reduce time to load by ensuring the css is loading from cache when available.|
|20936|UI|UI|"Limit Outputs to CSV" checkbox in Misc tab of the report designer has been deprecated in the 6.9.0.7 release. It will no longer show on the UI.|
|21524|Report Design|Forms|When Subreport created using Form designer (with Filter) is embedded with parent report. Subreport Filter is missing|
|21929|Dashboards|Security|Fixed shared with locks on new dashboards to work the same as reports. Izenda guidelines Full Access: Dashboard is available to the user to view, modify, and save changes to the report. Note that owner user(UserName property of the ReportSet) will not be changed on saving, i.e. the original owner(creator) of the report will stay the same. Read Only Dashboard is available to the user to view, user can modify existing filters' values. Also user can modify(design) the Dashboard but cannot save it, however user could Save As a new Dashboard. View Only: Dashboard is available to the user to view, but not to modify in any way or save changes to the report. Locked: Dashboard is available to the user to view, and user can modify existing filters' values None: Dashboard is unavailable to (hidden from) the user.|
|21556|UI|Data Sources|Izenda removes underscores contained in column names in Field Descriptions. This behavior was inconsistent in the Report Designer and the Instant Report Designer. Now, underscores are removed in both places.|
|21779|UI|Expressions|Added "Current Date" (Today) option to the DefaultDate setting. GETDATE() can be used in the expression text boxes.|
|20980|API|Filter|Fixed error in Report Viewer, when editing the filter operators list, if equals is removed it was still added as default filter operator when new filter is selected in report viewer. Now the first remaining filter operator available will be used as the default if equal operator is removed.|
|21527|UI|Filter|Corrected Stored Procedure Parameter use as Filters. User cannot add any parameter more than one time in the Report Viewer as this will give an error "Procedure or function ##SP_NAME## has too many arguments specified".|
|21456|Report Viewer|Filter|Long field names overlap the filter buttons. This has been corrected by truncating the field name using (...) to ensure buttons are clearly available to the end user.|
|21119|UI|Data Sources|Fixed Stored Procedure parameter support of European date format in equals calendar and equals filter options. Before fix when formatting date in European format (using equals or equals calendar) the report would return no results as date format was not properly converting.|
|22040|Report Design|Auto Chart|When using a stored procedure to create an AutoChart the chart was not properly exporting to excel after save. Now chart will export before or after saving the report.|
|22102|Report Design|Auto Chart|When exporting an auto chart that uses a link (links are added via the URL Link field of the advanced field options in the Report Designer), the chart appears correct but the export would only show one value as slice. This has been corrected so HTML/WORD/EXCEL export as shown on screen.|
|21717|Scheduler|Optimization|New Setting added for offline mode of Scheduler to initialize Visualization folder. AdHocSettings.VisualizationsFolder = @"Add Folder Path Here"; Please Note this MUST BE SET PRIOR TO LICENSE KEY|
|21814|Report Design|Auto Chart|Fixed long strings from overlapping chart in AutoChart. Long Stings will be truncated using (...) to prevent them from overlaying the chart|
|21866|Report Design|Auto Chart|When exporting an auto chart that uses a link (links are added via the URL Link field of the advanced field options in the Report Designer), the chart appears correct but the export would only show one value as slice. This has been corrected and PDF exports as shown on screen.|
|21689|Report Viewer|Forms|When a subreport which is created using "Form Designer" for image field is used, images are not displayed in the parent report.|
|21891|API|Data Sources|This fix ensures that names of temporary tables in generated sql queries will not have database name/schema nodes that were causing issues with some SQL versions when using Stored Procedures.|
|21846|API|Export|This interface is used to apply specific formats to excel exports when custom formatters are used in Izenda. Add the following to the formatter class: [Serializable] public class ProportionFormatter : IFormatter, IExcelFormatter { public string GetExcelCellClass { get { return "xls-"; } } ... The following formats are supported xls-text xls-percent xls-date xls-time|

# 6.9.0.1 (May 28, 2015)

## Important Note about 6.9:
**The command AdHocSettings.PrintMode is now deprecated. It has been replaced with AdHocSettings.PDFPrintMode will allow you to select between PDFMode.EO, PDFMode.iTextSharp and PDFMode.PhantomJS  PDF export engines. Please ensure that you have replaced this variable before running 6.9. AdHocSettings.ShowHtmlButton and AdHocSettings.ShowPdfButton have been introduced to specific control over the appearance of said buttons.**

## New Features: 
* **Auto-Gauges** - A new set of four gauges with a modern look and feel.
* **Dashboards 2.0** - A completely overhauled module which provides greater control over the look and feel of your dashboards. Learn how to install and use Dashboards 2.0 [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/Guides/Dashboards-v2).
* **PhantomJS Exporter** - An additional exporter emphasizing speed. **PhantomJS is not currently compatible with Azure PaaS installs, the EXE will not run in this environment.** It uses an EXE on the server instead of a DLL to move processing PDFs to a different thread than the Izenda's regular processing. Read more about it [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/API/CodeSamples/PdfPrintMode#PdfPrintMode).
* **Pivoted Analysis Grid** - New functionality offering a better breakdown of data over categories or periods of time

##Enhancements:
* **Virtual Data Sources** - A convenient way to use an existing report as a data source. Click [here](http://wiki.izenda.us/Virtualdatasource) for more information.
