#Introduction
Izenda now offers its new Angular.js Dashboard Designer / Viewer with the platform’s latest update to 6.9. Once implemented, any existing dashboards will automatically convert to the new dashboard format. While previous versions were limited to a static structure for the dashboard, tiles can now be resized. Users can add new tiles to any point on the grid in the Dashboard Designer. The dashboard displays with more fluid animation as well. The new Dashboard Designer/Viewer also includes a presentation mode, which allows the user to slide through dashboard tiles on a carousel.


#Features

* New responsive Angular.js Dashboards 
* User friendly user interface
* Modern Look and Feel
* Movable and resizable tiles
* Presentation Mode to scroll through full screen dashboard tiles

#Installation

##Webforms

1. [Download](http://www.izenda.com/update-your-izenda-version/) the full Webforms kit and replace the bin and resources folders within your projectt
2. Take the Dash.aspx and Dash.aspx.cs files from the downloaded kit and copy it to your project
3. Update Default.Master with the new changes to update links to Dash.aspx from Dashboards.aspx  
```c#
    <div class="top-nav applyStyles" id="blueHeader">
      <div class="page">
        <ul id="topnav" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
          <li class="top-nav-item"><a href="ReportList.aspx">Reports</a></li>
          <li class="top-nav-item"><a href="Dash.aspx?clear=1" onclick="ShowRlToDbLoading();">Dashboards</a></li>
```
4. In the global, update the dashboard viewer setting to AdHocSettings.DashboardViewer = "Dash.aspx";, as well as the dashboard designer setting to AdHocSettings.DashboardDesignerUrl = "Dash.aspx";. Additionally, set AdHocSettings.DashboardDateSliderMode = DashboardDateSliderMode.None;, this will enable between date filters to be exposed in the new dashboard. Without this setting date filters will not be exposed.

##MVC

1. [Download ](http://www.izenda.com/update-your-izenda-version/)the full MVC kit for 6.9
2. Copy the bin and resources from the kit downloaded into your project
3. Add:  _Dashboards-New-Head-Angular, _Dashboards-New-Body-Angular, _SiteLayout and Dash files to Views/Reporting. Ensure they are included in the project
4. Update the IzendaReportingController.cs to include:
```c#
    public ActionResult Dash() {

      return View();
    }
```
5. In the global, update the following: AdHocSettings.DashboardViewer = "Dash" and AdHocSettings.DashboardDesignerUrl = "Dash";. Additionally, set AdHocSettings.DashboardDateSliderMode = DashboardDateSliderMode.None;, this will enable between date filters to be exposed in the new dashboard. Without this setting date filters will not be exposed.

### Tips
* When upgrading, ensure log4net.dll and log4net.xml are in the Bin folder
* If you get an error stating System.Web.Mvc or System.Web.Mvc.Ajax are not in the namespace, right-click the file in the references, click properties and ensure Copy Local is true.

The user can repeat the process to add additional tiles

##Moving & Resizing Dashboard Tiles
The tiles can be resized by dragging the corners to the desired length or width.
Tiles can also be moved around the Dashboard. When the tile shows a green hue, it is positioned correctly and can placed on the grid. If the tile shows a red hue, it is not positioned on the grid properly and cannot be moved.
