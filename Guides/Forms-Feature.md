##14.1 Introduction To FORMS

Izenda FORMS is an add-on to Izenda REPORTS. It allows the user to input HTML5 into a browser-based HTML designer and then use that code to build an Izenda form report. Izendaâ€™s point-and-click interface is designed for the standard business user, with advanced options available for those with greater access and skill. Izenda FORMS is one of these advanced options. 

**FORMS Design NOTE1:** Though a basic user can easily make changes to existing forms, 
designing new forms does require a user who is comfortable with HTML5. Many users will 
never design FORMS, but simply make modifications to current core FORMS.

**FORMS Design NOTE2:** Izenda FORMS will override the normal reporting behavior within 
Izenda when a FORM is attached to a report; the FORM is what the engine renders. To use a standard Izenda report in tandem with a FORM, you must call the report into the HTML 
FORM itself.
